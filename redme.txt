Edmond-s-Blossom-Algorithm
Python and JavaScript version of Edmond's Blossom Algorithm, as described by Wikipedia

This is my attempt to translate the Blossom Algorithm described here 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blossom_algorithm into Python code 

I tried to keep comments to a minimum, since its all explained better by wikipedia and other online sources.
I also tried to use the same terminology as the wikipedia page

I am quite confident it works, after comparing 100s of test cases to another maximum matching algorithm (100% successful)
